# Traffic

## Built with Python and pygame - Convolutional Neural Network
Program running: https://youtu.be/jouUEvA9HM0

## How to run
Download the [data](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) set for this project and unzip it. Move the resulting gtsrb directory inside of the traffic directory.

AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python traffic.py gtsrb

This project uses TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, it uses a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

For this project, weâ€™ll use the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip) (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.
